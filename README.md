# Hello There! âœ‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. Here you can see many of the projects I am
involved in or have worked on in the past.

## About

I am a software engineer, data/machine-learning specialist, mathematician, and
all-around nerd. My formal background is in advanced theoretical mathematics and
computer science, and I have extensive experience with many programming
languages, and their associated ecosystems of tools, such as Python, R, SQL,
Lua, and Rust, to name a few.

But, what I am best at is learning, and as a nice corollary, I happen to also be
a pretty good teacher. I am quite good at picking up new material and quickly
familiarizing myself, to the point of being capable of implementing that
material in meaningful ways in other projects, even if it doesn't seem initially
related.

What I am passionate about is helping the human race to foster a healthy
relationship with our planet, all lifeforms, and the impressive cultural
milestones that we have managed to achieve, against all cosmic odds. I believe
in a doctrine of _live and let live_, because as far as any of us can tell with
some degree of certainty, our lives are the only shot we are given to explore
and understand what exactly it means to be human, in all our
different--beautiful--forms.
